1. Related Products API:
Objective: When viewing a product, we wanted to show related products from the same category (excluding the product being viewed).

2. Recently Viewed Products API (Optional, but polished the feature):
Objective: Track recently viewed products for the logged-in user. When the user views a product, we store the product ID in the recentlyViewed array and limit it to 5 products.
